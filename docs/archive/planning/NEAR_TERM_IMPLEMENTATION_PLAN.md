class CacheManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embedding_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=10000, ttl=3600)
        self.result_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=1800)

# AOT Integration for Query Simplification
class AOTQueryProcessor:
    async def preprocess_query(self, query: str):
        """Apply AOT decomposition-contraction for complex queries"""
        if self.is_complex_multi_hop(query):
            dag = await self.decompose_to_dag(query)
            atomic_query = await self.contract_to_atomic(dag)

            self.faithfulness_score(answer, context),
            self.relevance_score(query, answer),
            self.completeness_score(query, answer, context)
        )
        return QualityScore(scores)
```

### Week 5-6: Multi-Agent System

# Agent coordination
class AgentTeam:
    async def coordinate_agents(self, query: str):
        # Orchestrate specialized agents
        pass
```

### Week 7-8: Integration and Production

class StreamingAPI:
    async def handle_query(self, websocket, query):
        async for update in orchestrator.process_query_stream(query):
            await websocket.send_json(update)

# Production monitoring
class ProductionMonitor:
    def track_metrics(self):
        # Latency, throughput, quality metrics
        pass
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Test Structure
```python
# tests/unit/test_async_orchestrator.py
async def test_async_execution():
    orchestrator = AsyncOrchestrator()
    updates = []
    async for update in orchestrator.process_query_stream("test query"):
        updates.append(update)
    assert len(updates) > 0
    assert all(u["type"] in ["progress", "result"] for u in updates)
```

### Integration Test Structure
```python
# tests/integration/test_streaming_system.py
async def test_end_to_end_streaming():
    # Full system test with streaming
    pass
```

### Performance Test Structure
```python
# tests/performance/test_query_latency.py
async def test_concurrent_queries():
    queries = ["query1", "query2", "query3"] * 10
    start = time.time()
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        process_query(q) for q in queries
    ])
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    assert elapsed < 30  # All queries in <30s
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

3. **Performance regression**: Continuous benchmarking
4. **Integration issues**: Extensive integration testing
