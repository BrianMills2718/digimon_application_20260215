The reorganization moved ~200+ files from the root directory into appropriate subdirectories for better maintainability.
### Modular Architecture & Operational Modes

The system features a modular design with distinct operational modes, manageable via `main.py`, and increasingly, through agent-callable tools:

1.  **Build Mode (via `main.py` or Agent Tools):** Constructs knowledge graphs and generates all necessary artifacts (e.g., graph structure, vector databases).
    * Agent Tools available for building all 5 core graph types: `ERGraph`, `RKGraph`, `TreeGraph`, `TreeGraphBalanced`, `PassageGraph`.
    * Agent Tool available for `PrepareCorpusFromDirectory` (processes `.txt` files into `Corpus.json`).
    ```bash
    # Example CLI usage
    python main.py build -opt Option/Method/RAPTOR.yaml -dataset_name your_dataset
    ```
2.  **Query Mode (via `main.py` or Agent Tools):** Loads pre-built artifacts to answer questions.
    ```bash
    # Example CLI usage
    python main.py query -opt Option/Method/RAPTOR.yaml -dataset_name your_dataset -question "Your question here?"
    ```
3.  **Evaluate Mode (via `main.py`):** Assesses performance against benchmark datasets.
    ```bash
    # Example CLI usage
    python main.py evaluate -opt Option/Method/RAPTOR.yaml -dataset_name your_dataset
    ```

### Agent Benchmark Runner (`eval/run_agent_benchmark.py`)

For agentic QA benchmarking (MuSiQue/HotpotQA), use:

```bash
python eval/run_agent_benchmark.py --dataset MuSiQue --num 10 --model gemini/gemini-2.5-flash --backend direct
```

For Codex SDK runs, the default `--codex-profile compact` enables a lighter
prompt + tool surface (benchmark mode 2):

```bash
python eval/run_agent_benchmark.py \
  --dataset MuSiQue --num 10 --model codex/gpt-5 \
  --codex-profile compact --turn-timeout 120 --num-retries 0
```

The runner now includes post-run evaluation hooks:
- deterministic checks (`--post-det-checks`, default `default`),
- optional rubric review (`--post-review-rubric`, `--post-review-model`),
- optional gate policy (`--post-gate-policy`).

If `--post-gate-policy` is omitted, MuSiQue runs automatically use:
`eval/gate_policies/musique_default.json`.

To fail CI when a gate fails:

```bash
python eval/run_agent_benchmark.py --dataset MuSiQue --num 10 --post-gate-fail-exit-code
```

### Web Interface (API & UI)

A Flask API server (`api.py`) and an initial React UI provide user-friendly interaction, though current development is heavily focused on backend agent capabilities.
* **API Endpoints:** `/api/query`, `/api/build`, `/api/evaluate`.
* **UI:** Allows selection of datasets, methods, and initiation of operations.

### Available RAG Methods & Graph Types

* **Pre-defined Configurations:** `Dalk`, `GR`, `LGraphRAG`, `GGraphRAG`, `HippoRAG`, `KGP`, `LightRAG`, `RAPTOR`, `ToG`. These methods are compositions of underlying granular operators.
* **Supported Graph Types (for agent construction and analysis):**
    * **ChunkTree:** Hierarchical summary trees (`TreeGraph`, `TreeGraphBalanced`).
    * **PassageGraph:** Nodes are passages, edges link passages with shared (WAT-linked) entities.
    * **KG/TKG/RKG:** Graphs with explicit entities and relationships (`ERGraph`, `RKGraph`).

### Intelligent Agent Framework (Core Development Focus)

The central aim is an intelligent agent that dynamically plans and executes RAG strategies:
* **Granular Operator Tools:** The agent leverages ~16 conceptual retrieval and graph manipulation operators as its building blocks.
* **Structured Agent Tools:**
    * **Graph Construction Tools:** Defined with Pydantic contracts (`Core/AgentSchema/graph_construction_tool_contracts.py`) and implemented (`Core/AgentTools/graph_construction_tools.py`) for all five graph types. The `build_er_graph` tool has been successfully tested with live LLM calls.
    * **Corpus Preparation Tool:** `PrepareCorpusFromDirectoryTool` implemented and tested, allowing the agent to process raw `.txt` files.
* **Pydantic-based Execution Plans:** The agent's reasoning (planned or ReACT-driven) aims to produce structured sequences of tool calls.
* **Agent Orchestrator:** (`Core/AgentOrchestrator/orchestrator.py`) Executes tool calls based on the agent's decisions.
* **Agent Brain:** (`Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py`) Houses the core agent logic, including LLM-driven plan generation and answer synthesis from retrieved context (VDB search results, graph relationships, text chunks). Future work will enhance this for ReACT-style reasoning and more sophisticated strategy selection.
    * **End-to-End Pipeline Orchestration (Iterative Improvement):** The agent can currently orchestrate a multi-step RAG pipeline, including corpus preparation, ER graph construction, vector database building, entity search, one-hop neighbor retrieval, and text chunk fetching, culminating in an LLM-generated answer. Ongoing work focuses on improving plan robustness and answer grounding.

## Quick Start 🚀

### From Source
```bash
Clone this repository

cd Digimon_KG
Install Dependencies
The primary Conda environment is defined in experiment.yml.

Bash

conda env create -f experiment.yml -n digimon
conda activate digimon
(Note: environment.yml may also exist; experiment.yml is often referenced for the core setup).

API Keys and Configuration
Copy Option/Config2.example.yaml to Option/Config2.yaml.
Edit Option/Config2.yaml to include your API keys (e.g., OpenAI api_key for llm and embedding sections) and set desired default models (e.g., llm.model: "openai/o4-mini-2025-04-16").
Method-specific configurations (used by main.py) are in Option/Method/.
Custom ontology can be defined in Config/custom_ontology.json and referenced in GraphConfig or overridden by agent tools.
Supported LLM Backends
DIGIMON uses LiteLLMProvider for broad LLM compatibility, configured via Option/Config2.yaml:

Cloud-based models: OpenAI (e.g., "openai/gpt-4o", "openai/o4-mini-2025-04-16"), Anthropic, Gemini, etc.
Locally deployed models: Any LiteLLM-supported endpoint (Ollama, LlamaFactory-compatible).
Set llm.model to the appropriate LiteLLM string (e.g., "ollama/llama3").
Set llm.base_url if needed (e.g., "http://localhost:11434" for Ollama, though often LiteLLM handles this).
llm.api_key can often be set to "None" or a placeholder for local models.
Representative Graph RAG Methods & Operators
(This section can largely retain the excellent tables from your current README, as they provide valuable context on the original GraphRAG methods and the derived operators. I'm keeping it concise here for the handoff structure but you should integrate your full tables back.)

Graph Types Overview
(Integrate your existing "Graph Types" table here, comparing Chunk Tree, Passage Graph, KG, TKG, RKG across attributes like Original Content, Entity Name, etc.)

Retrieval Operators (Agent's Building Blocks)
(Integrate your existing tables for Entity Operators, Relationship Operators, Chunk Operators, Subgraph Operators, and Community Operators, including their Name, Description, and Example Methods.)

The DIGIMON agent's intelligence will stem from its ability to dynamically select, configure, and chain these operators to address complex queries.

🎯 Future Plans for DIGIMON (Agent-Centric)
This section outlines the specific future development goals for the DIGIMON agent and framework:

Agent Planning & Execution Enhancement:
[ ] ReACT-style Agent Core: Evolve AgentBrain to support a ReACT (Reason, Act, Observe) paradigm for more robust and adaptive multi-step task execution.
[ ] Advanced Planning Prompts: Refine prompt engineering for the PlanningAgent to effectively utilize all available tools (corpus prep, graph build, retrieval, summarization) and manage data flow between tool calls for complex queries.
Tool Development & Refinement:
[ ] Retrieval Tools: Define Pydantic contracts and implement robust agent tools for the remaining ~13 granular retrieval operators (e.g., for relationship retrieval, community analysis, advanced subgraph extraction).
[ ] Summarization Tool: Implement a flexible SummarizeTextTool for final answer synthesis.
[ ] Integrated Testing: Create integrated tests for all graph construction tools (similar to the one for build_er_graph) using real components with strategic LLM mocking/use.
Agent Intelligence & Strategy:
[ ] KG Structuring Strategy: Develop logic/heuristics/LLM-prompts to enable the agent to intelligently select the optimal graph type(s) and construction parameters based on the input data and user query.
[ ] Dynamic Retrieval Strategy: Enable the agent to dynamically choose and sequence retrieval operators to best answer a query given a constructed graph.
[ ] Ontology Management: Enhance agent capabilities for more dynamic interaction with custom_ontology.json, potentially including ontology selection or refinement suggestions.
Framework & Usability:
[ ] Evaluation Framework for Agent Strategies: Develop methods to evaluate the end-to-end effectiveness of agent-composed RAG strategies.
[ ] Comprehensive Documentation: Document the agent framework, all tool contracts, and provide example workflows.
[ ] Dockerization: Create a Docker image for easier deployment and reproducibility.
