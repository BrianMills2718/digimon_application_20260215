    steps: List[ExecutionStep] # The ordered sequence of steps the Agent Orchestrator will execute.

# Explanation of these models:
#
# These Pydantic models define the expected JSON structure for an "Execution Plan."
# ExecutionPlan is the top-level object.
# It contains a list of ExecutionSteps.
# Each ExecutionStep has an action which can either be a DynamicToolChainConfig (a list of ToolCalls for your granular operators) or a PredefinedMethodConfig (to run a full method YAML like Dalk.yaml). This Union gives the agent flexibility.
# The ToolCall model is key for dynamic chaining. Its tool_id will map to one of your ~16 KG operators (or new tools like web search). The parameters field holds direct values for the tool, while the inputs field allows sourcing data from plan_inputs or named_outputs of previous steps, enabling data flow. named_outputs declares what a tool call produces.
# OntologyConfig allows the plan to specify how the ontology should be handled, referencing your Config/custom_ontology.json or even allowing the LLM to define one inline.
